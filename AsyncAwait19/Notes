- In TypeScript, the async/await provides a cleaner and more readable way to work with promises, 
which makes asynchronous code appear more synchronous.
**** The async is used to declare a function as asynchronous, and await pauses execution until a promise resolves, which helps simplify the handling of asynchronous operations ****

- Advantages of Async/Await
Improved Readability
Easier Debugging
Simplified Error Handling
Enhanced Code Structure
