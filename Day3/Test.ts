//TS is Statically typed Programming language
let data=10; //number

//data="Ten"; //Compile time error

console.log(data);
//After Run the script in Console you will see value "Ten" only
//Because already it gave Compile time error

Ex2:
let data1:number=20;

//data1="Twenty";

console.log(data1);
//We need to mention the data type explicitly then only in console you will see error
