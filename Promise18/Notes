- A promise in TypeScript is an object that is used to represent the eventual completion or failure 
of an asynchronous operation.

- States of Promise
There are three states of Promise in JavaScript:

Pending: It is the initial phase, which represents that the asynchronous operations are still in progress.
Fulfilled: It indicates that the asynchronous operation has been completed successfully.
Rejected: It indicates that the operation has failed.

- Methods of JavaScript Promise
Promise.all() Method = takes an array of promises and waits for all promises to resolve, then it returns one promise. If any promise is rejected, it will reject it immediately.
Promise.any() Method = takes an iterable of promises and returns a single promise that resolves as soon as any of the input promises fulfill.
Promise.resolve() Method = The Promise.resolve() method returns a promise that resolves with the given value.
Promise.reject() Method = returns a new object that is rejected with a given reason.

Composing Asynchronous Operations
